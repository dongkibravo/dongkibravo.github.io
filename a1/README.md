=================

In this project, I have accomplished to use basic HTML or HyperText Markup Language linked with CSS or Cascading Style Sheets to make a simple website. But I still need some experience with styling HTML with css to make a more legitimate website. While I was working on this project, i have discussed about some problems with Bryan Zhang and Hyungseo Park and I spent about three and a half hours to complete this project.
